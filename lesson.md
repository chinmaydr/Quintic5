<h2>Developing Frontend/Backend Applications</h2>
<p>Defining how to get started with Python Development and APIs. We improve on 1st trimester curriculum and add visualization to these concepts.</p>

<h2>Subtopics we plan on teaching</h2>

<p>1. Setting up machines with Conda Scripts</p>
<p>2. Setting up GitHub Pages with FastPages features</p>
<p>3. Building requirements and pull requests in GitHub</p>
<p>4. Fetching and filtering content using JavaScript, HTML, CSS</p>
<p>5. Developing Backend 3rd Party APIs with analysis and cleaning Python, Flask, Pandas</p>

<h2>Lesson Plans</h2>
<p>For #1-3, we will make videos on the subjects that will teach how to set up each subject, since they are mostly installations and tool setups</p>
<p>For #4, we will make a page where the user can use various buttons to customize size, color, font, and other properties and attributes of a sample page.</p>
<p>For #5, we will make a page where the user can use various buttons to customize the choice of API, where each API will have different CRUD operations.</p>

<h2>Grading/Checking Work</h2>
<p>After the code for each activity on the website is shown, there will be a link to a Slack server where users can join, post, and talk about their beginner creations with web development.</p>
