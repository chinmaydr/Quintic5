Developing Frontend/Backend Applications
Defining how to get started with Python Development and APIs. We improve on 1st trimester curriculum and add visualization to these concepts.
----------------
Introduction
The world of software development is constantly evolving, and learning new skills and technologies is essential to stay ahead. This course aims to provide students with the skills needed to develop frontend and backend applications using Python and APIs. In this course, we will cover various topics, including setting up machines, creating GitHub pages, building requirements, fetching and filtering content, and developing backend APIs using Python, Flask, and Pandas.

Subtopics we plan on teaching
Setting up machines with Conda Scripts
Setting up GitHub Pages with FastPages features
Building requirements and pull requests in GitHub
Fetching and filtering content using JavaScript, HTML, CSS
Developing Backend 3rd Party APIs with analysis and cleaning Python, Flask, Pandas
Lesson Plans
Lesson 1: Setting up machines with Conda Scripts
In this lesson, we will provide a step-by-step guide to set up machines using Conda Scripts. We will cover installation and configuration, as well as best practices for managing packages and environments.

Lesson 2: Setting up GitHub Pages with FastPages features
In this lesson, we will teach students how to create a GitHub page using FastPages features. We will cover how to create a blog, add posts, and customize the layout.

Lesson 3: Building requirements and pull requests in GitHub
In this lesson, we will show students how to build requirements and pull requests in GitHub. We will cover the importance of requirements, how to create them, and how to submit pull requests for review.

Lesson 4: Fetching and filtering content using JavaScript, HTML, CSS
In this lesson, we will teach students how to fetch and filter content using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. We will cover the basics of each language, as well as best practices for fetching and filtering data.

Lesson 5: Developing Backend 3rd Party APIs with analysis and cleaning Python, Flask, Pandas
In this lesson, we will teach students how to develop backend 3rd party APIs using Python, Flask, and Pandas. We will cover the basics of APIs, how to analyze and clean data, and how to create APIs using Python.

Project Plans
Project 1: Customizable Sample Page
In this project, students will create a sample webpage with customizable properties and attributes. We will provide a template for the page and teach students how to add buttons to customize size, color, font, and other properties.

Project 2: CRUD Operations with Different APIs
In this project, students will create a page with different APIs and CRUD operations. We will provide a template for the page and teach students how to add buttons to customize the choice of API and perform CRUD operations.

Grading/Checking Work
After the completion of each lesson and project, we will provide a link to a Slack server where students can join, post, and talk about their beginner creations with web development. We will also evaluate students' work based on their understanding of the concepts and the quality of their projects. Students will receive grades based on their participation in the Slack server and the quality of their work.

Conclusion
In this course, we aim to provide students with the skills and knowledge needed to develop frontend and backend applications using Python and APIs. We hope that this
